Knit one, purl two
This sweater, my darling's for you
While vigil, you're keeping through rain and storm
This sweater will keep you warm

Purl two, knit one
Our trials I know have begun
And while you are fighting each battle through
My darling, my heart's with you

I just left the cot where our little Todd
In sleep was smiling
He must have dreamed of you

Knit one, purl two
My darling, whenever I'm blue
It's comfort to know that when he's a man
He'll be glad that his Dad came through

Knit one, purl two
