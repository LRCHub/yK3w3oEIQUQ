Well, the situation's this
It's not tough to comprehend
I divorced my wife
I left my child
And I ran off with a friend

But I want a tight-knit family
I want a group that harmonizes
I want my wife, and kid, and friend
To pretend the time will mend
Our pain

So I make them interact
So I don't go by the book

We all eat as one
Wife, friend, and son
And I sing out as I cook

I want a tight-knit family
I hope you all enjoy linguine
Talk 'til you hear the dinner bell
Such a dear clientele

I swear
We're gonna come through it
I fear
We'll probably fight

But nothing's impossible
Live by your wit
Kid, wife, and lover
Will have to admit
I was right
I cushioned the fall

I want it all!
I want it all!
I want it!

Sit down, my dear
I hear you have a problem
Im sure you're not disgusting or indiscreet
Take a load off your feet

Love is a mess
So's my son, expressly to hurt me
Marvin, my ex
You've seen him for years
Told me over the phone to tell you my fears
Do you only treat queers?

Breathe deep, my dear
You'll find me understanding
Your pain is a priori
Unfold you untold story
Now to break bread
Loosen your glands
Put your head in my hands

I'm everything he wanted
It's time I put it all together
The date was set
My father let my marry
I married
I
Then Marvin came from work
Sat me down on the bed
He told me how he loved me
How needed, that he valued me
I have?

Yes, syphilis
He said (Good)

I have (Yes?)
Syphilis
It's true (Good)

I had something rotten
Which appears that now it's well forgotten

Maybe, darling
Maybe, darling, so do you

I am probably diseased

You're a lovely girl

And so easily appeased

What a lovely girl
Though you're probably diseased

He took pills to not excite us
He explains I'd hepatitis too

Hepa, hepa, hepatitis, hepatitis, hepatitis

Love is blind
Love can tell a million stories
Love's unkind
Spiteful in a million ways

Then I stayed home from work
Took good care of my men
They faked despair, they wet their bed,
They combed their hair, they acted dead
One said? (Yes?)

Daddy is a prick (What?)

He said? (Yes?)

Daddy isn't mine (Good)

He filled my coats
With candies and notes
With "Will you be my--

Will you be my valentine? (Valentine?")

It's cathartic harder to believe

You're a damaged girl

I've a scalped up my sleeve

What a damaged girl

Do not ever slit your wrists

I've missed him; he's still missing
Don't make noise, but daddy's kissing
Boys

Petty, petty, petty, petty

Love is blind
Love can tell a million stories
Love's unkind
Spiteful in a million ways

Love is blind
Love can tell a million stories
Love's unkind
Spiteful in a million ways

Love is crazy (Love)
Love is often boring
Love stinks (Love)
Love is pretty often debris
When you find (Love)
What you find
Then never, never, never, never, never (Love)
Do it over again

Love reads like a bad biography (Love)
All the names are changed to protect the innocent (Love)

Love is blind

My name is Mendel
I treat her husband
I think she's very insecure
But so am I

I've never married
Work
Work is my passion
Or perhaps that's my alibi

I don't care to discuss it

I think she's charming
I think she's eager
That's unprofessional and mean
But still it's true

His name is Mendel (Ah-ah)

Return next Friday
I admit I admire you

Pick up all your clothes

Whizzer begs

Whizzer knows

Shave your legs

Make me sick

You're a prick

God you're impossible
We've been together for nine months
Ten months
Nine months
Ten months
Nine months
Ten months

We are the salt of the bourgeoisie

While I put the steak in

I bring home the bacon

And we're proud to say we love it how we
Don't (Won't)
Don't
Won't
Agree

Everything he owns is vile
Marvin doesn't care a whit
Marvin doesn't share my devotion to
Style

Men from France can cancel a debt
Men in cufflinks make me forget my name
I intend to upset
This regrettable game

Whizzer takes me by the neck

Isn't that a French lapel?

Whizzer has unlimited knowledge of
Dreck

Send me flowers

Mention is made

Make them roses

Attention is paid in full

See how quickly he sours

When he pushes, I pull

Pick up your clothes, Marvin
Breeding shows, Marvin

I was rich
He was horny

We fit like a glove

Close your eyes, Whizzer

Passion dies
But I'd kill for that thrill of first
Love

We ask for passion at all times
We stand to passion and drink this toast

Still it's awfully trying
And we're not denying
That of all the lesser passions
We like fighting most

Whizzer drinks too much to see
What a joy is chastity
What a joy is saving his joys
For one man

Leave me

Love me

Don't be a fool

Want me

Feed me

No one's so cruel
And cheap

What I love I devour

What you love you devour
What I covet I keep

Isn't that right, Whizzer?
Let's both fight, Whizzer!

I was trained in karate

I'm best when I cheat
So I'll cheat, Whizzer, and I'll shove
And I'll kill for that thrill of first
Love

We've been together for nine months
Ten months
Nine months (Oh! When are you gonna get over-)
Nine months
Ten months
In fact we've almost survived a year

True, but who is counting?
We're too busy mounting
A display of our affection
That is so sincere

Passion dies
Passion dies

I would kill for that thrill of first love
I would kill for that thrill of first love
I would kill for that thrill of first love
I would kill for that thrill of first love
I would kill for that thrill of first
Love
Love
Love
