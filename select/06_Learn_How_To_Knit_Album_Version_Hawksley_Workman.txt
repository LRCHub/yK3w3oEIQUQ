I don't have a cent this christmas
usual it seems
so i'm gonna learn how to knit

i'll knit you a sweater
i'll knit you a scarf
i'll knit you a cigarette holder
i'll knit you an aeroplane
to fly and meet me here
i'll knit you the nicest taxicab
to pick you up from the airport when you get in
i'll knit you some mittens
i'll knit you some socks
i'll knit you a cigarette holder
i'll knit you the perfect christmas feast
for us to share
i'll knit you a setting sun
that seagulls fly behind on the water
i'll knit you a blanket
i'll knit you a shawl
i might not knit anything at all
if my clumsy hands don't learn
to knit by christmas day
would you still invite me by
to celebrate the day in the morning
if all i brought was a kiss.
